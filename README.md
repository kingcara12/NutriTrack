## ✦ **Overview**

**NutriTrack Lite** is a **console-based Java application** that allows users to monitor the nutritional value of various foods.
Foods are categorized into:

* **Fruit**
* **Vegetable**
* **Protein**

Each item contains nutritional data including **Calories**, **Carbs**, and **Protein**.

The program applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and simple **file handling** to save meal summaries into a text file.

Users can:

* Add food to a meal
* View all available foods
* Search for food by name
* View total meal nutrition
* Save the result to a text file

All interaction is done through a menu-driven terminal interface.

## ✦ **Project Structure**

```
📂 NutriTrack/
└── 📂 src/
    ├── Food.java
    ├── Fruit.java
    ├── Protein.java
    └── Vegetable.java
    └── NutriTrack.java
    └── meal_summary.txt
```

### **File Description**

* **NutriTrack.java** – Entry point of the program, handles menu and user interaction
* **Food.java** – Parent class defining shared properties (calories, carbs, protein)
* **Fruit.java / Vegetable.java / Protein.java** – Subclasses extending `Food`
* **meal_summary.txt** – Stores saved meal summaries

## ✦ **Features**

1. **Add Food** – Create and add food items to the current meal.
2. **View All Foods** – Displays all foods grouped by category.
3. **Search Food** – Search any food by name.
4. **Meal Summary** – Calculates total **Calories**, **Carbs**, and **Protein**.
5. **File Saving** – Automatically saves meal results into `meal_summary.txt`.

## ✦ **Object-Oriented Principles Applied**

📌 **Encapsulation** – Private attributes in `Food` with getters (getName(), getCalories(), etc.)
📌 **Inheritance** – `Fruit`, `Vegetable`, and `Protein` inherit from `Food`.
📌 **Polymorphism** – Each subclass overrides the `displayInfo()` method.
📌 **Abstraction** – The main program uses functions without needing internal details
(e.g., `loadSampleFoods()`, `viewAllFoods()`, `searchFood()`).
